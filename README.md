# US-Airline-Dashboard
An user interactive dashboard is built using Streamlit and Python by loading the US Airline Twitter Sentiment Analysis data and the sentiment analysis of tweets are done using the same.
The dashboard shows random positive, negative and neutral tweets in the sidebar as chosen by the user.
It also visualizes the number of tweets by sentiments in the form of histogram and pie chart.
The dashboard also provides information when and where people are tweeting from as the user provides a particular hour of the day as an input in the slider.
It also visualizes the airline tweets by sentiment as a particular airline is chosen by the user.
The word cloud of a particular chosen sentiment is also displayed on the dashboard which gives us an insight which word is most frequently used in the text by the user.
